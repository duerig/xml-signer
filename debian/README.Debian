xml-signer for Debian
---------------------

The xml-signer software has to be made available via a web server. If
your web server is apache you can include the default configuration
included in the package or you can configure it manually.

To include the default configuration in your apache server, add the
following line within the appropriate VirtualHost declaration:

   # Add xml-signer
   Include /usr/share/xml-signer/etc/apache2.conf
